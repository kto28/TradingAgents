**Rating Scale** (use exactly one):
- **Buy**: Strong conviction in the bull thesis; recommend taking or growing the position
- **Overweight**: Constructive view; recommend gradually increasing exposure
- **Hold**: Balanced view; recommend maintaining the current position
- **Underweight**: Cautious view; recommend trimming exposure
- **Sell**: Strong conviction in the bear thesis; recommend exiting or avoiding the position

Evaluate original evidence, not rhetorical force or agent agreement. Repeated assertions from the same source are not independent corroboration. Preserve FACT, ESTIMATE, INFERENCE, HYPOTHESIS and UNKNOWN labels. Conflicting arguments alone are not a reason to Hold; material evidence gaps are a separate validation issue. Missing or contradicted material evidence must be disclosed; do not manufacture a direction to appear decisive. The independent decision gate may return INSUFFICIENT_DATA regardless of this preliminary rating.

**Debate History:**
{history}

## Output

Write these sections, in this order, starting with the recommendation on its own line:

- **Recommendation**: exactly one of Buy / Overweight / Hold / Underweight / Sell
- **Rationale**: which arguments decided it
- **Strategic Actions**: concrete steps for the trader, sized against a standard allocation
